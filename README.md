# Web Scraping Corona Virus data


This project demonstrates how to perform web scraping to extract COVID-19 data from websites using Python. It utilizes the `requests` module for making HTTP requests, `BeautifulSoup` for parsing the HTML content, and `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- requests module (install using `pip install requests`)
- BeautifulSoup module (install using `pip install beautifulsoup4`)
- pandas module (install using `pip install pandas`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to execute the web scraping script:
   python scrape_covid_data.py

4. The script will fetch the COVID-19 data from the specified website, perform web scraping using `BeautifulSoup`, and store the data in a structured format using `pandas`.

5. The scraped data will be saved in a CSV or Excel file, depending on the script configuration.

6. You can customize the script by modifying the URL, HTML parsing logic, data extraction methods, or data processing steps to fit your requirements.

## Example Output

Here's an example of the output after running the script:

Data successfully scraped and saved to 'covid_data.csv'.

## Credits

This project utilizes the `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` modules, which are widely used in Python for web scraping and data manipulation.

The data is sourced from reputable websites, such as government health agencies or international organizations, providing reliable and up-to-date information on COVID-19
